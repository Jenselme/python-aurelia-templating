Python Aurelia Templating
#########################

The goal of this library is to render templates written for the `Aurelia <https://aurelia.io>`__ JS framework with Python.

What I currently plan to support eventually:

- [X] Basic string interpolation.
- [ ] Support ``if.bind``
- [ ] Support ``repeat.for="friend of friends"``
- [ ] Import components with ``require``
- [ ] Slot injection
- [ ] Extended support for ``bind`` with things like ``class.bind``
- [ ] Support filters: ``${test | format}``

Resources: the `templating basics <https://aurelia.io/docs/templating/basics#introduction>`__ in the documentation.

I plan to work on this library from time to time.
If you want to contribute, please feel free to do so.
